			<h2 id="shortdesc">Has brought a new selection of mods into a pack for you to enjoy!</h2>
			<p>Welcome to STM(Space - Tech - Magic) modpack! This modpack offers 3 different themes in one
			semi light weight pack consisting of only less than 100 mods! Each part has a bit for you to sit 
			and enjoy while COVID-19 has us locked inside our houses! So why don't we go over some of the mods
			this pack has to offer to get an idea. First lets begin with tech, the tech tree its quite large and
			can be connected together, mods that are included are Thermal Expansion, Mekanism, Nuclearcraft and Ender IO.
			For magic however isn't the same story us the 3 mods (and one addon) we have are completely unrelated to each other
			those include Blood Magic , Astral Sorcery and Bewitchment. Space huh who though it could be a space themed modpack,
			for space we only have galacticraft however its much bigger due to the 2 addons we have installed you can explore our 
			entire solar system and even further! Have fun!
			</p>
